- 👋 Hi, I’m @morg-an
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of law, technology, and nonprofits.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects to learn to code. 
I eventually hope to develop a tool that everyday people can use to learn more about their legal rights.
